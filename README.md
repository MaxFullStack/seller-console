# Seller Console

## ðŸš€ Project

The **Seller Console** is a modern React application built with **React 19**, using **Vite** as the bundler and **TypeScript** for static typing. The focus was on applying feature-based architecture and best practices, following principles such as **SOLID**, **KISS**, **DRY**, and **Clean Code**.

The app uses **TanStack Router** and **TanStack Table**, with **Zustand** for global state management, **React Hook Form** for robust form handling, and **Zod** for comprehensive validations. The UI is built with **shadcn/ui** components and **Tailwind CSS 4**.

## ðŸš€ CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment

This project implements a complete and professional CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages, following international best practices.

### ðŸŽ¯ What has been configured:

**1. GitHub Actions Workflows:**
- `ci.yml` - Main pipeline with quality checks
- `deploy.yml` - Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages  
- `codeql.yml` - CodeQL security analysis
- `auto-update.yml` - Automatic maintenance

**2. Environment Strategy:**
- **Development** (`dev`) - Local development
- **Staging** (`staging`) - Staging environment at `/staging/`
- **Production** (`main`) - Production at root

**3. Quality Checks:**
- ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier
- Unit tests (Vitest) + Integration tests + coverage (80%+) - 106 tests passing
- E2E tests (Playwright) with proper timeout handling
- Security audit
- Mandatory quality gate

**4. Security Configurations:**
- Dependabot for automatic updates
- CodeQL for vulnerability analysis
- Branch protection (configure manually)

**5. Complete Documentation:**
- `docs/CI-CD.md` - Complete technical documentation
- `.github/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment and troubleshooting guide

### ðŸš€ How to use:

1. **Configure GitHub Pages**: Settings > Pages > Source: "GitHub Actions"

2. **Automatic deployment:**
   - Push to `staging` â†’ Deploy to staging
   - Push to `main` â†’ Deploy to production

3. **Manual deployment:** GitHub Actions > "Deploy to GitHub Pages" > Run workflow
