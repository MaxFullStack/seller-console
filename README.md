# Seller Console

## ðŸš€ Project

The **Seller Console** is a modern React application built with **React 19**, using **Vite** as the bundler and **TypeScript** for static typing. The focus was on applying feature-based architecture and best practices, following principles such as **SOLID**, **KISS**, **DRY**, and **Clean Code**.

The app uses **TanStack Router** and **TanStack Table**, with **Zustand** for global state management, **React Hook Form** for robust form handling, and **Zod** for comprehensive validations. The UI is built with **shadcn/ui** components and **Tailwind CSS 4**.
